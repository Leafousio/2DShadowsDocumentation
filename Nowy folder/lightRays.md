### Adding Light Rays <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

!> Adding light rays is easy, all you have to do is to **drag and drop their prefab**. **(unpack it too)**

?> I would also advise you to make your own light ray textures that will suit your game shape design, as itâ€™s a quick
process that can incredibly boost your game looks.
